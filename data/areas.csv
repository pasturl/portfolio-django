Artificial Intelligence;One of my passions is to implement and develop AI models to solve real-life problems. I have professional experience in the use of different supervised ML models: Artificial Neural Networks (FNN, CNN, LSTM, VAE, GAN, transformers, diffusion models), Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest. Use of unsupervised algorithms (k-means, KNN, HDBSCAN) and dimensional reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).;ai_ann.png
Big Data;I have developed and maintained data science projects in Big Data environments for large enterprises. Experience with different cloud providers (AWS, Google cloud, Azure, databricks). Knowledge of tools such as S3, EC2, Airflow, Lambda, MongoDB. Use of structured and unstructured data sources (text, image, video, geospatial data). I have trained large deep learning models using clusters of GPUs and supercomputers.;big_data.png
Business;I work at Mango, a multinational fashion company. I have experience in different industries: pharmaceutical, healthcare, banking, insurance, automotive, chemical industry, entertainment, food retail, and marketing. Expert in translating client needs into project requirements to maximize impact. I have performed planning, budgeting, and development of over 30 data science projects.;business.png
Programming;I have experience in software implementation using Python, PySpark, R, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I have developed very complex projects in big data architectures. I like clean code implementation following good programming practices. Use of Gitflow, CI/CD tools (Jenkinks), and process orchestration (Airflow). Implementation of agile methodology, and use of management tools such as Jira.;programming.png
Visualization;I enjoy processing and analyzing data to prepare visualizations and dashboards to help understand the data to communicate results to stakeholders. I have developed graphics and web applications using tools such as plotly, streamlit, shiny, D3.js. Preparation of interactive visualizations using ML models, embeddings, images, graphs.;visualization.png
Healthcare;I have a bachelor's degree in Biology and a master's degree in Neuroscience. During my PhD I was part of a research group in data science applied to healthcare. Recently, I published a scientific paper on BRAF mutation in melanoma. I participated in a Hackathon about neurofibromatosis related-cancer. I have been working on a personal project to translate sign language. ;neuroscience.png
